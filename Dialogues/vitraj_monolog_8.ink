Stanchi's chicken?#karl:yes #speaker:narator #text_position:up
I remember now!
I came back drunk and hungry as a wolf.
There was nothing to eat, so drunk as I was, I took the chicken Stanchi gave me and slaughtered it in the bathtub.
That's why there were blood stains on my sleeve!
I was so drunk and hungry, it's a good thing I didn't eat it raw.
I... I didn't kill anyone.
I AM NOT A MURDERER!
I really want to finish this now.
